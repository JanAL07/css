    <p> SDG 5: Gender Equality aims to empower all women and girls alike. Ending all forms of discrimination
        against women and girls is the very main goal of this SDG. There are numerous problems with gender equality laws not
        in tow such as inequality in education, gender bias in healthcare, and etc. There are also international statistics that show
        gender equality changes needs to be done efficiently. <br> <br> This is seen with
        Pakistan ranking as the least gender-equal country, followed by Sudan,
        where conflict has worsened conditions for women, alongside with Middle
        East and North Africa currently having the largest gender gap of around 152
        years to close, with Europe having the smallest gap. Also, Philippines claims the 20th spot in the global
        gender index, topping over many countries. We could definitely improve this though with more support and assistance for gender equality. We have statistics down the table below.</p>

    <p> The Philippine certainly does gender equality seriously well. Currently, we
        see that there are a lot Filipinas in top positions everywhere! Women and
        girls in the Philippines get better freedom compared to the others in other
        countries. In recent times, the Philippines has also achieved
        significant progress towards gender equality, shown by a growing
        representation of women in positions within both public and private sectors
        of leadership. <br> <br> Over the past 30 years, the Philippines has
        done great advancements in fostering gender equality and in minimizing
        discriminatory practices against women and numerous laws have been
        enacted and policies established to tackle gender issues and matters. Among
        the major obstacles though are the stereotypical views and cultural
        traditions held by certain Filipinos regarding women's societal roles, which
        really has to be changed.

        This is where I come in. As an advocate for gender equality, I want to make this website to add meaningful support on the subject and to let voices unheard be heard.  By raising awareness,
        it becomes my responsibility to help women and girls in practice too.  I aim to make gender equality more prominent rather than just some sort of fun idea by helping both men and women to be more equal. Down below are my own made images for SDG 5.
