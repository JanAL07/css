    One of the many global backgrounds of gender equality includes the women’s rights movement. It's a varied social movement which is primarily rooted in the United States. 
    It flourised more during the 1960s and ’70s aimed for equal rights and opportunities along with increased personal freedom for women. It occurred alongside and is acknowledged as a segment of the “second wave” of feminism.
    Our group aims to give additional aid for gender equality and this movement with this website and more upcoming projects to come.

    Want to know some gender quality information in the Philippines? Well, according to a 2024 report from the Philippine Commission on Women, and other official data, gender equality in the Philippines still has a long way to go. In fact, the Philippines recently received its lowest score in over ten years on the World Economic Forum’s Gender Gap Index.
    There is clearly room for more improvement.

    Now, this is where I and many others come in. As an advocate for gender equality, I want to make this website to add meaningful support on the subject and to let voices unheard be heard. By raising awareness,
    it becomes my responsibility to help women and girls in practice too. I aim to make gender equality more prominent rather than just some sort of fun idea by helping both men and women to be more equal. 
    My own made images for SDG 5 are shown on the above and below.
